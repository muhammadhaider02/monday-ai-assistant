## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

The workflow is triggered when a chat message is received. Users can interact with the agent using natural language commands such as:

- "Update the status of task 'final' to 'Done'"
- "Change the due date of task 'Website redesign' to next Friday"
- "What tasks are currently in 'In Progress' status?"
- "Create a new task called 'Review marketing materials' due on October 15"

The AI agent will:
1. Process the command using Claude AI
2. Fetch necessary metadata from Monday.com
3. Execute the appropriate API calls
4. Provide confirmation when the action is complete

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent this
- API keys and tokens should be kept confidential
